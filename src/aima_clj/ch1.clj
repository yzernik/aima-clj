;; 1.1 Define in your own words: (a) intelligence, (b) artificial intelligence, (c) agent, (d)
;;rationality, (e) logical reasoning.

;; 1.2 Read Turingâ€™s original paper on AI (Turing, 1950). In the paper, he discusses several
;;objections to his proposed enterprise and his test for intelligence. Which objections still carry
;;weight? Are his refutations valid? Can you think of new objections arising from develop-
;;ments since he wrote the paper? In the paper, he predicts that, by the year 2000, a computer
;;will have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test with an unskilled interrogator.
;;What chance do you think a computer would have today? In another 50 years?

;; 1.3 Are reflex actions (such as flinching from a hot stove) rational? Are they intelligent?
